### Makefile

(from [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32480480/what-is-the-meaning-for-dot-before-the-target-in-makefile))

A clean **Makefile** with

```
all:
        echo "all"
test:
        echo "test"
```

Gives the following output

```
echo "all"
all
```

Adding a dot on a separate line in the start of the file

```
.
all:
        echo "all"
test:
        echo "test"
```

Results in an error `Makefile:1: *** missing separator.  Stop.`

Adding a . before the *all* target

```
.all:
        echo "all"
test:
        echo "test"
```

Results in the target *test* being run

```
echo "test"
test
```

## Health

I haven't lost interest but my ability to care has been fairly limited
mostly due to longterm mental health issues but also due to some other
things. Recently I've worked off-list a bit with Jia Tan on XZ Utils and
perhaps he will have a bigger role in the future, we'll see.

It's also good to keep in mind that this is an unpaid hobby project.

Anyway, I assure you that I know far too well about the problem that
not much progress has been made. The thought of finding new maintainers
has existed for a long time too as the current situation is obviously
bad and sad for the project.

A new XZ Utils stable branch should get released this year with
threaded decoder etc. and a few alpha/beta releases before that.
Perhaps the moment after the 5.4.0 release would be a convenient moment
to make changes in the list of project maintainer(s).

Forks are obviously another possibility and I cannot control that. If
those happen, I hope that file format changes are done so that no
silly problems occur (like using the same ID for different things in
two projects). 7-Zip supports .xz and keeping its developer Igor Pavlov
informed about format changes (including new filters) is important too.
