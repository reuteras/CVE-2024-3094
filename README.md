# CVE-2024-3094

I've moved my notes in Obsidian to a separate vault and this GitHub repository to be able to share it.

The start page is [CVE-2024-3094 xz supply chain](./202403300902%20CVE-2024-3094%20xz%20supply%20chain.md).

## Installation

Clone the repo with `git`.

```
git clone https://github.com/reuteras/CVE-2024-3094.git
```

Then open the checked out folder as a vault in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).
